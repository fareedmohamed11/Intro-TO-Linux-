1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,890
Instructor: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,420
In this lecture, we will learn Ubuntu operating system.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,470
Now most of the command

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,210
that we have learned previously works

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,600
on Ubuntu and CentOS both except few.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,610
We will see the difference

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,320
and then you will find yourself

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,020
that's more or less same operating system

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,980
except some changes.

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,600
So let's bring up the Ubuntu OS.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,600
So I have it in vagrant /f/vagrant-vms/ubuntu

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,190
is the vagrant file,

13
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,463
vagrant global -status.

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,240
Okay, so CentOS VM that is powered off

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,770
and Ubuntu VM, it is powered off.

16
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,070
This is same from VM setup lecture.

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,680
So you should be also having this.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,293
All you can do is vagrant up.

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,020
The VM already is created

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,213
it's just going to power on the VM.

21
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,250
Okay, VM is up.

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,173
Let's log into it, vagrant ssh,

23
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,673
and let's clear the screen.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,513
Let's check the OS, etc/os-release.

25
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,300
It's Ubuntu 22.

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,313
switch to the root user.

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,780
Let's check the logged in user.

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,550
it's root now pwd,

29
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,190
you're in root user's home directory.

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,170
So most of the command in Ubuntu

31
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,440
is same as CentOS except few.

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,770
Starting with the command useradd,

33
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,630
there is useradd command in Ubuntu,

34
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,307
if you run this, you say useradd

35
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:32,343
and let's say devops.

36
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,890
So it does add the user.

37
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,650
If you switch to that user,

38
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,333
you'll see some problems.

39
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,480
So there's no home directory, okay?

40
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,340
So it just took you to the root directory.

41
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,690
There is no home directory.

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,740
So when you use useradd command in Ubuntu

43
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,300
it will not create the home directory,

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,800
It will not create the mailing spool

45
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,660
and so many other things.

46
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,387
So I'm going to delete userdel -r devops.

47
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:03,128
see it says,

48
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:05,340
"There's no home directory found while deleting

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,680
and no mail spool found."

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,850
which you can specify,

51
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,190
you can use with -useradd option,

52
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,600
You have useradd command,

53
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
you have some options.

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,010
You can specify the home directory.

55
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,780
But the easy way in Ubuntu

56
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,303
is to use adduser command.

57
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,871
instead of useradd,

58
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:25,620
We have adduser in Ubuntu.

59
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,130
Let's do that, adduser

60
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,140
and it's also passwd included with that

61
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,230
So it is showing you that it has created a user devops,

62
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,480
created a group called as devops

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,180
and then adding devops user to devops group,

64
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,160
creating home directories

65
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,383
and moving files from /etc/skel.

66
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,050
So when you create user in Linux system

67
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,580
it'll copy all the files

68
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,360
from /etc/skel directory to users home directory.

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,680
And these are some files

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,530
we are going to see them in Bash scripting.

71
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,690
Next it is also asking the password

72
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,740
so we can enter the password also

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,350
and we'll ask some other information

74
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,210
like full name, room number,

75
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,310
work phone, blah blah blah.

76
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,350
Just keep hitting Enter

77
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,120
and if you're good with this

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,403
just say yes, Y for yes.

79
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,500
Okay, you should see the user devops

80
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,910
and rest everything the same,

81
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,913
passwd command, group add command,

82
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:24,840
usermod command, okay?

83
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,500
So that's one difference from CentOS to Ubuntu.

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,150
Adduser instead of useradd.

85
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,260
The other one is visudo command if you run,

86
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,190
we know it opens the sudos file in vi editor

87
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,070
but in Ubuntu the default editor is nano.

88
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,580
So if you hit Enter here

89
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,990
it'll open this file into nano editor.

90
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,220
If you know nano editor,

91
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,110
it's fine, you can use that.

92
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,943
But if you don't know,

93
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:53,370
you can just say Control + X to quit.

94
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,953
We want the default editor to be VIM.

95
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,380
So we can run this command,

96
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,707
export EDITOR=vim.

97
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,120
Now how this command works, export EDITOR=vim.

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,650
We are going to see that in Bash scripting.

99
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,630
These are variables

100
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,760
and this is setting variable temporarily

101
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,870
on your current shell.

102
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,430
If you logout and login,

103
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,110
you have to do it again.

104
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,760
But now if you run visudo,

105
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,610
it should open it in VIM editor.

106
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,893
There you go, okay?

107
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,713
And you can use colon Q to quit.

108
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,280
So that's the second difference.

109
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,510
Before running visudo,

110
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,460
you run export EDITOR=vim

111
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,353
if you want VIM editor.

112
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,320
But if you log out and log in,

113
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,051
then you have to do it once again

114
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:47,040
and we can make it permanent.

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,803
Also, again, we are gonna see that in Bash scripting.

116
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,913
Okay, the main difference is package manager.

117
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,030
So let's do the same thing.

118
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,010
What we really did in CentOS,

119
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,113
we'll download a tree package.

120
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,170
So in your browser,

121
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,360
just search for tree debian package for Ubuntu

122
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,790
and you should see ubuntu.package.org

123
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,013
or you can look for other sites as well.

124
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,700
And let's scroll down here

125
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,940
and you should see the mirror

126
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,290
and binary package URL.

127
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,490
So that's the URL.

128
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,000
You can just copy that

129
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,630
and you can say wget

130
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,583
or you can do curl also, paste that.

131
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,780
So it should download the debian package

132
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,863
and to install it dpkg -I tree.

133
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,950
Okay, now the tree command should be there, it's working.

134
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,080
To list all the debian package in your machine.

135
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,903
You can say dpkg -l.

136
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,340
And if you want to search something from there

137
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,760
you can say dpkg -l pipe grep

138
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,933
and the package name.

139
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,280
If you want to remove dpkg -r tree,

140
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,440
it's gonna remove the package.

141
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,750
That's manually downloading and installing it, right?

142
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,630
But as we have yum in Red Hat machine,

143
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,193
here we have apt.

144
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,530
So /etc/apt,

145
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,300
let's get into this directory

146
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,000
and you should see a file here sources.list.

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,067
This will contain the repository information, right?

148
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,360
So you have different URLs over here

149
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,350
and if you want you can add any new repository information.

150
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,490
But whenever you make change

151
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,500
or if you want to install any software

152
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,210
in Ubuntu or any Debian machine,

153
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,130
you run the command apt update first.

154
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,440
So it'll go and check all the repository

155
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,740
for the latest package and create a list.

156
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,000
You don't need to do that with Yum

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,260
because Yum will anyways.

158
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,110
Search first, create a list

159
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,753
and it can refresh the list every 24 hours.

160
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,890
But this is the place where Ubuntu or Debian

161
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,990
really beats Red Hat system

162
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,600
because of its software access.

163
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,360
It has tons and tons of softwares,

164
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,789
which is available from

165
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:16,170
so many repositories around the world.

166
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,050
So you an apt update, you update the list

167
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,280
and then you can see apt search tree

168
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,590
to search for a package named tree.

169
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,300
And you'll see so many packages

170
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,593
which has the name tree.

171
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,420
You can see apt install tree.

172
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,300
This also apt -get, which is older one.

173
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,993
You can just use apt and hit Enter.

174
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,660
So download and install and again with dependencies.

175
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,120
So tree does not have any dependencies

176
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,780
but if you want to install package like Apache 2

177
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,842
which is same as httpd,

178
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:55,863
in CentOS here we have Apache 2.

179
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,310
Well, that is having some dependencies.

180
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,360
It says these are the packages that will get installed

181
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,090
and it's also suggesting some other packages.

182
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,900
If you're good, you say Yes

183
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,430
and it'll download the package

184
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,503
with all the dependency and install them.

185
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,950
So Apache 2 is a service

186
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,783
and in Ubuntu,

187
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:21,990
if you install any service,

188
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,213
it'll start it automatically.

189
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,060
You'll see Apache 2 should be

190
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,970
already active and running,

191
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,870
Q to quit and it should be also enabled.

192
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,633
So if you see S is enabled,

193
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,913
it's also enabled.

194
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,327
So if you want to upgrade all the packages in Ubuntu,

195
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,170
you can say apt upgrade

196
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,620
and apt update is different,

197
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,440
apt update is just going to check the list

198
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,880
and update the list.

199
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,240
App upgrade will actually actually upgrade all the packages.

200
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,910
So this many package to be upgraded

201
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,410
I don't want to upgrade it now.

202
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,210
So I'm gonna say N,

203
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,570
you also have apt remove to remove the packages

204
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,433
like Apache 2 you want to remove.

205
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,060
There's also one nice option when you're removing it.

206
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,373
Let's install this package once again.

207
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,450
So we know apt remove is going to remove the package

208
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,550
but it'll not remove the configuration

209
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,090
and the data of those service or package.

210
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,830
If you want to remove cleanly,

211
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,720
like everything you can just say apt purge

212
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,320
and it'll remove the package

213
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,580
with all its configuration and all its data, okay?

214
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,113
A clean uninstall.

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,230
When you're installing

216
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,590
or uninstalling any such services in Ubuntu

217
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,210
like Apache 2 is a service.

218
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,840
It's a network service which will serve the webpages.

219
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,483
It is also going to update the firewall rules.

220
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,633
UFW is Ubuntu firewall.

221
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,610
So these are some differences that we have seen.

222
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,840
There are a few more different commands

223
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,520
which we'll be seeing in Bash scripting

224
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,190
and cloud computing AWS.

225
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,800
But that should be all for now.

226
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,210
So practice these commands

227
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,883
so you get hold of Ubuntu operating system also.

228
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,160
That's all in this video.

229
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,710
I will see you in the next one.
