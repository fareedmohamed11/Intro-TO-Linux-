00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,850
Welcome to this video.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:09,080
In this video, we will be talking about services that are running in your Linux system or if you happen

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,400
to run your own service, how you can manage that.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,500
So we have installed a package httpd, lets do it once again.

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:29,120
And it's already installed, httpd, is a Web service and the package name is httpd again,

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,850
so you say yum install httpd, it will install the package and you should have also a service named

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:42,250
httpd now, which can be managed by systemctl command. systemctl status httpd.

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,180
It will show you the status.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,800
It says it's inactive.

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,630
Now, if you want to start the service, you can say systemctl start httpd.

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,150
And let's check its status again.

12
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:03,130
It should show active, so you see here some processes running, these are the process id.

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,830
Will get into what our processes and process IDs in the next video.

14
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,390
But really what it means to run a service means there are some processes running.

15
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,090
You want to start the process or you want to stop the process or you want to restart the processes.

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,780
You can use a systemctl command for a service.

17
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,940
So, like, start and stop, you also have an option of a restart.

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,610
If you make some changes, configuration change to your service, you can restart the service, so it

19
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,360
takes effect.

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,480
There's also one more option, instead of restart, you can try to reload or to reload the configuration

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,370
without even restarting the service.

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:56,150
So we started the service and it's running, but it's just running for now, if I reboot this machine

23
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,110
while booting up, this service will not come up.

24
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,150
I'll show that to you. Lets do exit.

25
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,070
And the exit, or I can just say reboot.

26
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,480
So if you want, you can do vagrant reload. exit out the vagrant reload or from the system, you can say

27
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,560
reboot and it should reboot your vm.

28
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,820
So before we reboot, you see the status was active, but after it comes up, let's see whether it's

29
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,640
running or not.

30
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,210
OK, it's up.

31
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,160
I have logged in.

32
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,650
Let me become the root user.

33
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:39,400
And now let's check the status, httpd and you see it's inactive, so it did not come at the boot time.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:47,200
If you want to bring up a service at the boot time, then you have to say systemctl enable and the service

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,030
name like httpd

36
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,670
Now the service will come up at the boot time.

37
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,260
So it is only for the time if you really want to start the service, then you have to say.

38
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,720
systemctl start and the service name.

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,320
So far, have you been doing ssh to this machine through vagrant ssh and there is actually a service

40
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,010
called ssh, you can check its status if this always happens to be stopped.

41
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,820
We will not be able to do ssh. We will get into ssh in much more in detail in shell scripting.

42
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,110
OK, few other commands you want to check whether a service is running or not.

43
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,370
You can just run this command.

44
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,040
Also, systemctl is-active and the service name, it is inactive.

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:43,330
Because you see its status is stopped, you can say start, so we did enable, but we did not start the service.

46
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,160
Now, it started.

47
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,220
OK, so you can run systemctl status, but if you just want to check if t's active or not, you

48
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,240
can say is-active.

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,980
Like is-active, you also have is-enabled.

50
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
So it will tell you whether the services enabled for the boot time or not.

51
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,940
OK, so the way systemctl really works is based on its configuration file.

52
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,010
So for httpd, there should be a configuration file and this got created when you when we installed

53
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,630
htpd

54
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:30,900
OK, so the filepath is this system, the system slash multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service

55
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:38,120
So when we say systemctl  start httpd, it's going to read this file and we'll see execs start

56
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,810
how to start.

57
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,700
So this is actually the binary, which it is running with some options.

58
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,260
And some argument, so it really is going to run this command to start the service, to stop it's going

59
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,570
to run that command will understand what's a kill command later in processes.

60
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,250
So this configuration file got created automatically when we installed httpd through yum

61
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,700
But we'll see other way, when we just have a tar ball download and extracted, we don't have a

62
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,310
systemctl file to start the services, but we can create our own also that we're going to do later.

63
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,560
But that is all for now.

64
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,360
I will see you in the next video.
