1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,740
Instructor: Again, now to follow most

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,240
of the lecture in this section,

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,580
we will need the Vagrant VM

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,890
that we created in the previous section.

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,740
Most of the lecture follows on centOS

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,960
but then we have openSUSE also.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,350
Run the command vagrant global -status,

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,120
to check the VM status

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,533
and where they are located.

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,070
Right, so we we're going to get into this folder

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,360
so cd /f/vagrant-vm/centos/

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,360
switch to the folder that shows, over there,

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,970
where you created the VM, right?

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,410
Let's clear the screen

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,210
and we'll do vagrant up to bring up this VM.

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,570
Okay, it's going to take a moment.

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,403
It's the same VM.

18
00:00:43,403 --> 00:00:45,390
The VM was already created for me

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,550
so it is just powering on now.

20
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,410
I don't know if that's even a correct grammar,

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,263
powering on, so it's just coming up.

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,930
Okay, it's up in less than a minute.

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,753
vagrant ssh, to log into it.

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,319
Okay, I'm in the VM

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,963
and I'm going to issue the command clear.

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,260
Okay, now, four very basic commands.

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,180
First, whoami,

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,220
see what user you are.

29
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,380
Say, it's vagrant user.

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,110
pwd, present working directory,

31
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,610
it will show you where you are.

32
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,721
So, vagrant user is in vagrant's home directory

33
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:25,383
/home/vagrant.

34
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,720
ls command to see

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,910
what is there in the current directory,

36
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,813
there's nothing.

37
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,680
cat command to read a file

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,100
and we will mention this file path /etc/os-release,

39
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,380
this file shows what is the operating system

40
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,423
and what version it is.

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,183
Okay, now look at the prompt.

42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,320
This is the user, we checked it.

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,950
whoami command, vagrant user, at the rate,

44
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,290
hostname, so there's no hostname set,

45
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,943
so by default will be localhost,

46
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,210
tilda symbol that represents

47
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,759
that you are in the home directory.

48
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,080
Home directory of what?

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,670
Of vagrant user.

50
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,107
So, we did pwd.

51
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:14,850
You see, we are in the home directory

52
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,170
of vagrant user /home/vagrant,

53
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,570
and then a dollar that represents

54
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,540
its a normal user shell.

55
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,470
Now, watch, I'm going to run this command, sudo-i.

56
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,010
This command will switch

57
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,260
to root user from vagrant user

58
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,500
and only vagrant user has permission

59
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,060
to switch to root user,

60
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,780
so vagrant user can, anytime, run sudo -i

61
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,520
and switch to root user.

62
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,570
Now, look at the prompt.

63
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,253
Once again, it has changed.

64
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,480
Username, root hostname

65
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,100
and tilda means the home directory of root user.

66
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,930
And hash means this is the root user's shell.

67
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,330
Now, check once again, whoami?

68
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,320
root user,

69
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,180
pwd, /root.

70
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,970
Now, /root is the home directory

71
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,040
of the root user, right?

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,510
Observe there is a slash

73
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,823
at the beginning and then slash root.

74
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,540
Let's do cd /,

75
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,770
this means go to the root directory.

76
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,543
I don't want you to confuse here,

77
00:03:24,543 --> 00:03:27,360
/, just a / at the beginning

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
or only the / means the root directory,

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,953
which is different from the root users home directory.

80
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,050
Watch this, cd /, pwd,

81
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,060
I'm in the root directory,

82
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,190
not in root user's home directory.

83
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,500
I'm in the root directory.

84
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,040
Do ls and you should see all the files

85
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,680
that is present in the root directory.

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,130
Or you can say,

87
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,550
these are all the files in this operating system.

88
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,000
Observe there is /, there is a home, right?

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,180
That's why this /home, right?

90
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,920
And there should be root there,

91
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,000
root, right?

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,340
That's why it's /root.

93
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,280
So, we are in the root directory now.

94
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,370
Once again, this is root directory.

95
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,043
This is root users home directory.

96
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,070
If it's still confusing, don't worry,

97
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,433
we will get into this in detail later.

98
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,370
For now, I want you to become comfortable

99
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,160
with the commands, with the basic commands.

100
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,953
Now, if you type cd and hit Enter,

101
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,870
then you'll come back

102
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,670
to the home directory of the user.

103
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,230
You see that, it changed to tilda

104
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,170
if you do pwd, see /root.

105
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,220
So, whenever you're lost,

106
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,080
you can do cd and hit Enter.

107
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,110
You come back to the user's home directory, right?

108
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,330
Also, check what user you are, right?

109
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,273
So, you come back to that user's home directory.

110
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,223
Now, I am clearing the screen.

111
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,710
Now, let's understand the directory structure

112
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,170
cd /,

113
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,850
this is called as the root directory.

114
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,650
Forward slash is the root directory.

115
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,960
And if you do ls here,

116
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,670
you will see all the directories

117
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,810
or files that you have

118
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,403
in this Linux operating system.

119
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,520
This is the top level directory

120
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,350
of Linux operating system

121
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,750
or any Nix operating system.

122
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,770
So, you should see here,

123
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,970
a root that is the root

124
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,930
user's home directory.

125
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,000
You should see a home directory

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,330
inside that you'll have users' home directories.

127
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,310
You see etc for configuration boot directory

128
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,050
where you have bootloader and kernel.

129
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,550
You see media /mnt for mound points,

130
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,470
/opt, it's an optional directory

131
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,973
and we'll be using that later.

132
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,330
So, home directory /root for root user

133
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,760
normal user /home/username.

134
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,293
User executable is in /bin.

135
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,910
There's bin directory.

136
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,480
So, we are already here in the root directory.

137
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,250
We can just do cd bin.

138
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,720
If you are somewhere else,

139
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,543
you can do cd /bin.

140
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,540
Okay, you're giving the absolute path.

141
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,730
This is called as absolute path.

142
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,733
Absolute path always begins with the root directory.

143
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,490
And /bin, if you do ls,

144
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,173
you should see a lot of files.

145
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,400
These are mostly the user executable programs

146
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,060
like mv, is to move files,

147
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,720
scp to copy files to remote Linux machines,

148
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,840
yum, and you'll see many more.

149
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,130
You'll see all your commands

150
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,383
that you're using as a normal user here.

151
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,284
Like whoami,

152
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:43,117
pwd.

153
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,853
So, these are user executable programs.

154
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,720
If you go to /usr,

155
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,853
sorry /sbin,

156
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:57,506
these are the programs

157
00:06:57,506 --> 00:07:00,030
that are executable by root user

158
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,213
like for example, mkfs.ext4,

159
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,010
this is for formatting partition,

160
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,010
which cannot be done by the normal user,

161
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,800
reboot command, to reboot your operating system.

162
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,500
This can be executed by normal user also,

163
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,827
provided you give sudo

164
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,813
and many other system executable commands.

165
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,203
So user executable, system executable.

166
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,353
Let's see the configuration directory.

167
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:35,280
/etc and you should see here the configuration files

168
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,514
and directories, like hostname.

169
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:39,570
If you wanna change the hostname,

170
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,220
you can see this file.

171
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,900
You can give the complete cat /etc/hostname/

172
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,550
and you should see the current hostname.

173
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,860
If you want, you can edit this file and change it.

174
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,870
We'll be learning that,

175
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,063
how to edit files through vi editor.

176
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,060
Yum configuration

177
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,790
which is the package manager in Red Hat machine.

178
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,729
Like you have Google Play Store

179
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,213
on your Android phone, like that.

180
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,480
Networks configuration and so many other

181
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,470
configuration files.

182
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,293
We'll be seeing a lot of files from this directory.

183
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,623
Temporary files, /tmp.

184
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,930
We'll be using these directories also,

185
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,910
especially when we write scripts

186
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,500
and you want to put some temporary data,

187
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,940
we'll put it in /tmp directory.

188
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,920
And most of the automation tool

189
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,500
is so many tools when they're doing some operation,

190
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,840
they need some files for temporary purpose,

191
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,270
they'll use /tmp directory.

192
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,679
Do not store anything over here,

193
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,000
which you want to use later.

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,390
This is just for temporary purpose.

195
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,523
/boot kernels and bootloaders.

196
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,733
cd /boot.

197
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,060
So, that's your bootloader, initramfs,

198
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,953
vmlinuz, that's your your kernel.

199
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,520
And there's a grub directory inside this

200
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,920
where you'll have the configuration for booting,

201
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,480
grub2, this you get it more into system administration.

202
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,020
You need to change the booting parameters

203
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,880
the kernel version, stuff like that.

204
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,893
Then, you can use these configurations.

205
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,540
/var, or /srv to store the server data.

206
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,130
We'll be seeing that later.

207
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,890
System information, /proc /sys.

208
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,023
Let me show you one example from this.

209
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,340
If you are anywhere in the Linux system

210
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,240
and if you want to come back

211
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,260
to your home directory,

212
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,630
you can just say cd and hit Enter.

213
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,630
You'll come back to your home directory.

214
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,460
From here, let's go to /proc

215
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,110
and you will see some files over here.

216
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,610
These are dynamic files.

217
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,630
Mostly, they'll be changing

218
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,550
based on the system information.

219
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,770
Like for example, there is a command called uptime

220
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,980
which will read how long the system is up and running.

221
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,950
So, the system is up from past 13 minutes.

222
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,960
It'll show you how many users are logged in

223
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,850
and the current load average.

224
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,830
We'll understand load average later.

225
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,090
But what I want to point you here

226
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,370
is this is a command that reads information

227
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,203
from this file.

228
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:14,520
You should see uptime file here

229
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,250
that you'll have some information,

230
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,250
/proc/uptime but it may not be user readable.

231
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,210
Or you have command like free -m

232
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,160
which shows you the RAM size.

233
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,720
And these things are dynamic.

234
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,860
These things changes

235
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,540
and that's why content in this directory

236
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,953
will be regularly changing.
