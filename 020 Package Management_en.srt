1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,090
Software management or generally in Linux, we call them as packages.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:14,290
So so far in your life, you must have installed or uninstall so many software on your Windows computer

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,690
or MacOS or your smartphones.

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,710
In the next, there are very different different methods of installing or setting up a package or software,

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,090
we're going to start with very basic one and then we're going to see different other methods of setting

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:30,800
up software.

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:31,950
So.

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,310
Log into your Linux VM and switch to root user.

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,630
And first, we are going to hit a command called tree. tree is a very interesting command, it shows directory

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:51,950
in a tree structure, like if you want to see the /var/log directory structure inside that subdirectories

11
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,750
and files, it will show it in a tree format, but it says command not found.

12
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,450
And no, don't try to use yum command here

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,240
We are going to see first a very manual way of setting up a package.

14
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,390
So open your browser.

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,570
And we'll search for the tree package on the Internet, download it and install it so you can just say

16
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,070
tree rpm

17
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,890
And hit enter.

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,320
And you should see various repositories like there is CentOS.pkgs.org and there is rpmfind

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,080
rpmseek, rpmpbone

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,010
So there are so many repositories on the Internet from where you can find and download the R.P.M.,

21
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,960
so I'll go with this R.P.M Find for now.

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,740
Let's click on it.

23
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,250
So it's pretty simple here, you can make a search and you should find the R.P.M. for tree, and there

24
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,570
are many rpm based operating system like you have fedora you have.

25
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:58,540
Maggie, you have open Susie, so R.P.M. packaging will be different for different different flavors.

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,500
We are looking for CentOS, so let's find CentOS , thers centos8, centos7

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,120
So since we have centos seven, we have this R.P.M..

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,900
I can click on it and it will download it in my local machine, but I want it to be downloaded in the

29
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,620
Linux machine.

30
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,370
So I'm going to right click

31
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:25,020
Copy link address and go to my shell and I'm going to use a command called as curl.

32
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:32,350
Which will be by default in your system, linux system, you say curl and paste the command

33
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,720
And you have to use -o

34
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:44,930
So curl will access this link, -o saying that output of this link should be saved to a file and

35
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,530
you can give a name to a file, will give the same name as the R.P.M. name.

36
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,440
And hit enter.

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,570
OK, if you do a ls now, you should find the R.P.M. in your current working directly where you executed

38
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:57,920
the curl command.

39
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,320
.

40
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:07,810
And to install it, we have the command R.P.M. -i I used to install, v for verbose, which means printing it

41
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:14,650
h is for  human readable, so print it in a human readable format when you're installing and you give

42
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,850
the path of the R.P.M..

43
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,020
And you will see that quickly got installed because really a very small package now you can have the

44
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,740
tree command.

45
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,870
tree /var/log

46
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,960
OK, you can see now the directress in a tree structure.

47
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:41,210
So that was just one example of installing an R.P.M. in a Red Hat Centos machine, and now maybe we're

48
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,200
excited and you want to install more software.

49
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:51,320
I am looking for a software package called httpd, which is a Web server package.

50
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,710
And will be seeing how it works, but right now we just worried about installing it, so we'll find

51
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,890
the right R.P.M. for cento seven that's there.

52
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,710
So I click copy, link, address.

53
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,360
I do the same thing.

54
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,540
I say wget, sorry, curl

55
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,050
And I paste the link, you can also use shift insert in gitbash to paste.

56
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:24,430
-o and copy the name of the file and just paste it. You select it, it will be copied,

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,160
you do a middle click and it will be pasted.

58
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,990
OK, you should have the R.P.M. now and now, let's try to install it, rpm -ivh httpd

59
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,400
It does not work, It says failed dependencies.

60
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,470
It's saying that you need to install these other RPM's.

61
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:54,020
And once you install this, then only you can install this as httpd rpm, so there is a dependency.

62
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,890
Now, there is just 4 dependency.

63
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,700
You can really find those download and install them, and then you can install httpd

64
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,070
What what if you have hundreds of dependencies?

65
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,610
Yeah, and that's the case so many times because in Linux principle, we understood we have small,

66
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:15,750
single purpose programs right now that are chained together to perform complex operations.

67
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,320
So you will very, very regularly hit this dependencies problem and that can be solved very easily.

68
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,740
Like we have rpm, which can install the package or you can even uninstall package.

69
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,000
You have other package managers also like yum for RedHat.

70
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,750
Before we go there, let's see some more option in R.P.M. rpm --help

71
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:55,020
Like you have -e to erase or you have -q to query. -a for all the files. Like query or verify all the

72
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,530
files.

73
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,240
So let's see some option.

74
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,120
rpm -qa

75
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,890
This will list all the rpms.

76
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,680
OK, maybe you're looking for some r.p.m. if you want to see whether it's installed or not.

77
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,860
Again, just a pipe grep like tree.

78
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:19,470
And if you want it, is that you can see rpm -e and then you can give the rpm name.

79
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,100
it will be gone.

80
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,130
Erased, now tree command

81
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,110
is not there.

82
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,320
Like that, there are many options with rpm. rpm -ivh  we have seen to install or capital U

83
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,550
to upgrade a package. e is to remove or erase

84
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,460
-ev --nodeps, so it's going to erase the installed package without checking its dependencies.

85
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,830
-qa to  to list all the RPM's.

86
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:55,360
-qi If you want more information, or qf, if you want to find out what package a file belongs to, so

87
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,770
you see some file and you want to see which package does this file belongs to.

88
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,870
OK, you can say rpm -qf, qc to list configuration of files for a package. That can

89
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,480
come handy when you're doing some troubleshooting with package management, but the better option for

90
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,630
managing your package is yum yum.

91
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,750
Let's see how that works.

92
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,590
So as we go on the Internet, search for R.P.M., download and install, instead of that, you can use

93
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,950
yum, which will do all that for you.

94
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,890
It will automate the process of package installation or management so that it does by using some configuration

95
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,310
file.

96
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,120
/etc/yum.repos.d, in this dir.

97
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,220
You should see some files, these files points to some repositories on the Internet, like, for example,

98
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,990
CentOS-base.repo

99
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,360
So it will have information of the repositories, so when you install any linux operating system, it will

100
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:03,710
always have access to some repositories. Like this is one repository information, mirrorlist, and that's

101
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,020
the url.

102
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,410
Like that all the files will have some repository information from where your yum can search for the

103
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,820
software, download and install and that also with dependencies.

104
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:25,760
OK, so like when I say yum search httpd, so I'm searching for a package named httpd in all those

105
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,630
repositories.

106
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:35,539
OK, so there are so many package that has a name like httpd-devel, which is for Devlopment httpd,

107
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:40,650
just like that, httpd manual, httpd tools and many, many other packages.

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,910
So if I want to install that, I'll simply say, yum, install a httpd.

109
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:56,420
So it turns out to be it's going to install a httpd plus its dependencies also, so it's saying

110
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,070
I'm installing this four dependencies and then this package.

111
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,950
So download and install with a dependency and I'm good with that.

112
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,530
I'll say y for.

113
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,080
Yes.

114
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,020
And that's it, it's installed.

115
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,070
If you happen to remove that, you can just see yum remove httpd

116
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,840
And I said, yes, remove that.

117
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,820
So now downloading and installing is very easy, Just yum install and the package name.

118
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,700
OK, now let's say I want to install a package, yum install jenkins.

119
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:47,940
And it says error, it has nothing to do because Jenkins package is not available in any of the repositories

120
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,460
that are available here.

121
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:59,490
So if it's not there, then you can always search for the Internet, you should find the vendor documentation

122
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,740
there, they'll mention the steps to install a particular package.

123
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,580
So let's take Jenkins' as an example.

124
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,380
And let's search for install Jenkins.

125
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,400
And I'm going do the official documentation, which is always preferred.

126
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:22,130
jenkins.io and it should have method of installing Jenkins in different, different environment.

127
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,520
You have Linux Mac OS, so let's click on Linux.

128
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,220
So scroll down, you have steps to install it on Debian machines, which we'll be doing later.

129
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,130
If you scroll down, see, you install Java.

130
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,400
method for fedora.

131
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,000
And or Red Hat/ CentOS, yes, we found that.

132
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,070
OK, so these are the commands.

133
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:51,690
So it's saying sudo wget. wget  is going to be working like curl, but first you need to have wget,

134
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,400
so let's install wget first and you can say that is a dependency for us.

135
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,350
yum install wget

136
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,530
So it is already installed.

137
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,840
So saying wget -o, output should be in this file.

138
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,450
And it's just accessing this link, a backward slash there means you can give it in, command in two lines

139
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,310
lines, so I just copy that.

140
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,740
So what this first command is doing, it is going to create.

141
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,820
This file with the repository detail.

142
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,400
It created the repository details over here.

143
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,560
OK, nice.

144
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,370
Now let's check the next command, rpm import.

145
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,750
So there is a key.

146
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,690
Sometimes you will have a key for a repository.

147
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,810
So you may have R.P.M. import command and a link.

148
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,670
So this key will provide us access to this repository.

149
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,670
And then yum upgrade it is saying, which is going to upgrade all the packages, which, if you want to skip.

150
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,410
Because that's going to take a very long time.

151
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,850
So it is Yum, install Jenkins and a Java.

152
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,270
Especially JDK.

153
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:21,840
Let's try that, so now Jenkins will be installed from this repository and then you have Java that will

154
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,610
be installed from our regular repositories and I'm going to say -y

155
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,910
-y so it does not ask me any question, yes or no, you see, there're like sixty 65 dependencies.

156
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,850
Which is installing Java and then it's installing Jenkins'.

157
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,450
Right.

158
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,500
So, you see, it's easy to do it with yum, but then yum should have access to the right repository

159
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,300
to download and install your software.

160
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:54,080
All right, so there is a command to directly create that file, sometimes you will see instruction

161
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,360
to open the file and put some content for the repository yum upgrade command.

162
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,130
You see, it's going to upgrade all the packages if you run a yum upgrade.

163
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:13,080
It's going to read all your packages and match it with the latest packages, and it will say there is

164
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:19,670
an update available so total 127 packages can be updated and one new package will be installed.

165
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:25,260
And this is going to take some time, but it is always preferred to update all your packages because

166
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,930
it may have security vulnerability or performance issue that can be fixed by this new patches.

167
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,560
And I'm going to say y.

168
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,160
And it's going to take some time.

169
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:43,060
OK, so yum search to search for a package, install to install a package, you have reinstall sometimes when

170
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:48,730
you're installing things, breaks, network go down and the package is not installed properly, you

171
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:55,450
can always reinstall. yum remove to remove a package yum update to update all the packages.

172
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,280
Or you can specify a package name, yum update and a package name.

173
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,940
You have group of softwares also like you have development group.

174
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,760
You can say, yum group list, it will show you group packages and then you can if you want to install

175
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,470
group packages, you can see a young group install and a group name which will install the group of

176
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:21,400
packages. yum  repolist to list all the enabled repositories that you have access to.

177
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,580
Sometimes you need to run this, command, yum clean all, which is going to clean clear the cache.

178
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:35,140
of your repository. yum history, to see the previous history of Yum. yum info packagename will

179
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,510
give you information about a particular package.
