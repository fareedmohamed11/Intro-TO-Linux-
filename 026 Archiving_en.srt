00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,330
Hello and welcome in this video, we will be talking about archiving.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,480
So there's so many times where you need to archive files and directories.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,219
Especially when you want to take its back up or if you have a back up, you want to restore from that,

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,960
or if you have some files that's coming from the Internet or from somewhere else, it's an archive format.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,140
You want to unarchive it.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,760
So let's take an example, will go to /var/log dir and let's see if you want to archive all the

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,090
logs or let's see, we just want to archive the Jenkins logs.

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:42,210
Now there is a file jenkins', so mostly we do archiving of log files to move it to somewhere else so

9
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,180
we can clear the log files and save the disk space.

10
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:52,930
So I'm in a /var/log dir and I am going to archive the Jenkins' dir, so first we're going

11
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,800
to see with tar command

12
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:10,290
tar -czvf, c is to create, z is to compress, so archiving and then compressing it, v

13
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,500
is for  verbose and f is for file.

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,750
And I first give the archive name.

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,080
So I'm going to say jenkins_

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,310
I'll give some timestamp.

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:32,650
.tar.gz, which is the extension to represents a Tarball, gz represent, it was compressed

18
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,660
with z option, gunzip.

19
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,110
And then you give.

20
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,780
the path, which we really want to archive and compress, so that's Jenkins dir.

21
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,270
And you should see then.

22
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:56,510
Lets run ls -ltr, so it sorts properly, we see the Tarball there and this is called as tarball and we

23
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,990
can run a file, command and see, even if it does not have an extension, you can run file, command

24
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,640
and see what kind of file it is, Right?

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,550
It's gunzipped.

26
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,200
compressed data.

27
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:18,190
OK, let's see how we can unarchive it, so let's move it to /tmp/ dir and let's go to /tmp/ dir

28
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:29,970
So that's my tarball there, I want to extract it, so tar -x is for extract, c for will create,

29
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,910
x is for extract and the same options zvf

30
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,860
And if you give the path

31
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,010
And then you should see the Jenkins' dir there.

32
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,760
If you want to extract it somewhere else so you can use a -C, Capital C option and let's say

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,710
I want to extract /opt dir

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,650
So let's see /opt dir

35
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,640
You should see the jenkins dir there, extracted. So tar is legacy or old archiving command

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,750
of Linux, and it is still used. There are lot of options for it.

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,100
Its feature, Rich Tool.

38
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,870
So the top you should see some examples of tar command, you can see all the options you can compare to

39
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,460
tarballs by using -d

40
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,170
Or you can update an existing Tarbell.

41
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,720
You have more compression option you can use -a for auto compress, this -j for bzip2

42
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,660
-J for xz

43
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,990
These are other compression method like we used z for gunzip, you have bzip and you have xz.

44
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,070
Also for compression.

45
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,160
We have seen, -C to mention the dir, where we want to extract and many more.

46
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,950
Such interesting options really feature rich.

47
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,420
But much more simpler is really a zip command.

48
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,340
So let's do the same thing with zip command, zip command will not be available to you to install it.

49
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,930
So I'm going to say yum, install zip and unzip both.

50
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:18,640
And lets clear the screen, so same operation, I'm going to say zip -r, you have to give if you are 

51
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:27,220
compressing a directory or  archiving directory. and I say httpd_06122020

52
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,250
12, 20, 20.

53
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,990
It's a back up, or it's a tarballs.

54
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:38,260
I would like to give a timestamp and then dot zip and then give the dir that you want to extract

55
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,370
Oh

56
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,330
Not this one.

57
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:49,690
I will extract the Jenkins' Jenkins underscore zero six one two, any dir that you would like

58
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,560
to archive.

59
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:54,970
Right.

60
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:08,730
Right, so that's our archive and same thing, let's move it to and this time let's move it to /opt dir.

61
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,790
OK, let's go to /opt dir.

62
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,730
Now, you have existing Jenkins dir over here, which it will try to overwrite

63
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:27,340
I'm going to remove that dirs and I'll say unzip Jenkins dot zip.

64
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,510
So unzip is just one zip

65
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:39,300
So you have two General method for archiving, tar and zip and will be using both, you know, of course,

66
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,230
when the need comes.

67
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,330
So that's all in archiving practice this command.

68
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,850
And I will see you then in the next video.
